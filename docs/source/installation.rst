Prerequisites
=============
The version python is assumed to be over 3.9+, and
the nifs package requires some python packages: numpy, xarray, psycopg2 and matplotlib.
IPython is recommended for interactive use.

In addition, C++ external libraries: retrieve-dbstore-SDK, libana2 have to be intalled in advance.
The procedures of downloading and installation of which are discribed below at first.



Retrieve-dbstore-SDK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`Retrieve-dbstore-SDK`_ is required for :py:mod:`nifs.rawdata` module to retrieve raw data from LABCOM server.
This SDK is available from `LABCOM Download page`_
or you can use ``wget`` command as follows:

.. prompt:: bash $
    
    cd ~/  # To download retrieve-dbstore-SDK to user home directory
    wget http://w3.lhd.nifs.ac.jp/LABCOM_Softwares/Retrieve/retrieve-dbstore-22.0.0.sdk.el8.tar.gz
    tar -xvzf retrieve-dbstore-22.0.0.sdk.el8.tar.gz
    mv SDK retrieve-dbstore-SDK  # rename

Finaly, configure the following environmental values in .bashrc:

.. prompt:: bash $

    echo "export RETRIEVE_PREFIX=$HOME/retrieve-dbstore-SDK" >> ~/.bashrc
    echo "export INDEXSERVERNAME=DasIndex.LHD.nifs.ac.jp/LHD" >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc


If you would rather download the SDK from website directly, you must choose CentOS8 SDK
whatever linux distribution your PC depends on. And replace path names in the above code line with your own setting.



libana2
~~~~~~~~
`libana2`_ is a client library
to use Kaiseki Server and experimental database. :py:mod:`nifs.anadata` module requires this library.
The source files are availabe from a git server. You can download it by ``git`` command:

.. prompt:: bash $

    cd ~/
    git clone http://kaiseki-dev.lhd.nifs.ac.jp:/git/kserver


Compile the libana2 library after moving into libana2 directory:

.. prompt:: bash $

    cd ~/kserver/libana2
    make install-head
    make install-lib

Afterwards, make sure that both include and lib directories are made in ~/kserver/libana2.

Configure the following environmental values in .bashrc:

.. prompt:: bash $

    echo "export LIBANA2_PREFIX=$HOME/kserver/libana2" >> ~/.bashrc
    echo "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$LIBANA2_PREFIX/lib" >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc

Make symbolic links of .client.ini and .client2.ini files which are stored in ~/kserver/kaiseki-client2 directory.

.. prompt:: bash $

    ln -s ~/kserver/kaiseki-client2/.client.ini ~/.client.ini
    ln -s ~/kserver/kaiseki-client2/.client2.ini ~/.client2.ini

Or you can put these files into $HOME directory directly.


Installation
============
NIFS package is available from our `development repository`_.
Once you have the source files, locate the foloder containing setup.py and run:

.. prompt:: bash $

    python setup.py install

If all the required dependencies are present (numpy, psycopg2 and matplotlib),
this should start the NIFS package compilation and installation process.

.. warning:: 

    Be sure to follow the above procedure of installing external C++ libraries before installing the NIFS package, otherwise, compilation errors
    might occur.


When developing NIFS package, it is usually preferred that the packages be installed in "develop" mode:

.. prompt:: bash $

    python setup.py develop

This will cause the original installation folder to be added to the site-package path.
Modifications to the code will therefore be visible to python next time the code is imported.


Testing
========
Many of the demos used throughout the NIFS documentation are distributed with the source code in the ``demo`` folder.
